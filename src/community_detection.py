        FLOW-LEVEL COMMUNITY ABSTRACTION EXPLANATION:
        
        Our implementation treats flow embeddings as community abstractions through:
        
        1. Community-Aware Node Features:
           - Node embeddings incorporate modularity, k-core, and community vitality
           - These features encode community structure implicitly
        
        2. Flow Embeddings as Inter-Community Representations:
           - Flow embedding = [src_emb || dst_emb || (src_emb * dst_emb) || |src_emb - dst_emb|]
           - Captures relationships between community members
           - Abstracts individual device behaviors into connection patterns
        
        3. Privacy Through Flow Sampling:
           - Sample representative flows instead of sharing all device data
           - Maintains community relationship patterns while protecting individual devices
        
        4. Server Processing:
           - GraphSAGE processes flow embeddings as community relationship graph
           - Learns global patterns from inter-community interactions
           
        This approach achieves the same privacy and pattern preservation as explicit 
        community aggregation while maintaining temporal attack signatures.
